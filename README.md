# Web-based CV (Code Challenge)

##  ⚠️ Currently under development! ⚠️

For this challenge, was suggest the creation of a web-based curriculum vitae to show, in practice, the extent of my knowledge and abilities in TypeScript, React and Sass.<br/>
It was my first time using TypeScript and Sass from strach in a project.<br/>
I was inspired by the Wes Anderson aesthetic to create UI of this web-based CV.<br/>
This Web-based CV have 3 pages, reusable components, a timer, dark mode, header and footer that remains the same on every page, unit tests (Jest), redirects to my personal websites (Linkedin, Github and Portfolio), responsive design and it was deployed at Netfly.
