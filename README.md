# Web-based CV (Code Challenge)

##  ⚠️ Currently under development! ⚠️
- Media queries of the header are not working as expected in mobile screens. Currently fixing it!

For this challenge, was suggest the creation of a web-based curriculum vitae to show, in practice, the extent of my knowledge and abilities in TypeScript, React and Scss.<br/>
It was my first time using TypeScript and Sass from strach in a project.<br/>
I was inspired by the Wes Anderson aesthetic to create the UI design of this project.<br/>
This Web-based CV have 3 pages, reusable components, a timer, dark mode, header and footer that remains the same on every page, unit tests (Jest), redirects to my personal websites (Linkedin, Github and Portfolio), responsive design (currently doing some fixings) and it was deployed on Netlify.
